Hi. I'm Nuttanart Pornprasitsakul or you can call me Tap. I'm a programmer originally from Thailand, currently living in Guangzhou, China.

I've been working full-stack professionally for 8 years, loves all the backend works while have lesser experiences in UI design and CSS. My past works includes automate server provisioning, system monitoring, deployment pipeline, performance tuning, data import, data processing, mid-scale refactoring, web api, multiple services system, client-side browser based app.

I fall in love with Clojure/ClojureScript, have been using them primarily for the past 2 years. I do also have familiarity with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Ansible and Unix (OS X and Debian family). Some other technologies which I have significant experiences are Java, JavaScript, RabbitMQ Docker and AWS platform.

Iâ€™ve been doing Test-First for 7 years combining it with relatively recently known, incremental development with REPL. I know how to apply them practically. During development, I'm striving for simple design software. Love clean code and maintainability but do understand fast feedback loop, business urgency need and getting things done.

I do have [some open source contributions](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apublic+author%3Avisibletrap) and specifically [code and docs contributions](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Apublic+author%3Avisibletrap) (requires Github account to view it).
