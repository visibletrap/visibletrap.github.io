Hi. I'm Nuttanart Pornprasitsakul or you can call me Tap. I'm a programmer from Thailand.

I've been working professionally for more than 10 years, mostly full-stack. My past works include automate server provisioning, system monitoring, deployment pipeline, load testing, performance tuning, data import, data processing, mid-scale refactoring, web api, multiple services system, rich client-side browser based app, queueing system and high-traffic system.

I fall in love with Clojure/ClojureScript, have been using them primarily for the past 4 years. I do also have a huge familiarity with PostgreSQL, Redis, Ansible and Unix (OS X and Debian family). Some other technologies which I have significant experience with are Ruby on Rails, Java, JavaScript, RabbitMQ, Docker and AWS platform.

I have a good understanding of software design, development agility, devops, continuous delivery, test-first development and incremental development via repl.

I always strive for simple design software. Love clean code and maintainability but do understand fast feedback loop, business urgency needs and getting things done.

I do have [some open source contributions](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Apublic+author%3Avisibletrap), specifically [code and docs contributions](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Apublic+author%3Avisibletrap) (requires Github account to view it).
