Hi. I'm Nuttanart Pornprasitsakul or you can call me Tap. I'm a programmer from Thailand, currently living in Guangzhou.

I’m almost full-stack developer except UI design and CSS. Love all the backend works. Have experiences with automate server provisioning, system monitoring, deployment pipeline, performance tuning, data processing, mid-scale refactoring, web api, multiple services system, client-side app.

I’ve been doing TDD for 6 years, know how to apply it practically. Striving for simple design software. Love clean code and maintainability but do understand fast feedback loop, business urgency need and getting things done.

Technologies that I'm the most familiar with right now are Clojure, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Ansible and Unix (OS X and Debian family). I do also have significant experience with other technologies such as Java, JavaScript, RabbitMQ and Docker.
