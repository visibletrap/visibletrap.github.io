Love all the backend works. Have experiences with automate server provisioning, system monitoring, deployment pipeline, performance tuning, data processing, mid-scale refactoring, web api, multiple services system, client-side app.\r\n\r\nI’ve been doing TDD for 6 years, know how to apply it practically.
